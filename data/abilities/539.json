If an ability could either hinder or help this Pok\u00e9mon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.\n\nAbilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.\n\nAn ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pok\u00e9mon's moves can paralyze a Pok\u00e9mon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pok\u00e9mon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.\n\nWhen this Pok\u00e9mon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.\n\nThis ability functions identically to teravolt and turboblaze.",
